# Correlation-Power-Analysis-Attack

In this project, Python Programming Language is implemented to design a power analysis attack to decipher the hidden key based on pairs of plain text input to the computer and the cipher text generated by the computer. The power analysis attack is carried out by observing the computer's power consumption pattern
